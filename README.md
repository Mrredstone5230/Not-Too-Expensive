# Not-Too-Expensive

This is a minecraft spigot plugin allowing the "removing" of the "too expensive" bar in an anvil. (It basically limits how far the max RepairCost) (Spigot link: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/not-too-expensive.86820/)

This plugin is highly inspired by https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/customrepaircost.18822/, so please check it out ! (Github repo: https://github.com/jamezrin/CustomRepairCost)
